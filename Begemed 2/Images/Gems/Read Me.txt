External Gems
By DFortun81

Gems are 72x72 20-frame Animated GIF files that
the Begemed 2 engine will recognize and load into the game.

NOTE: If you prefer to have faster load times, it is recommended 
that you only have 5 or 6 gem files in this folder. 
But you MUST have at least one. A Gem is considered a Mask, an Image,
and a light image, "_" at the end indicates a Mask.

NOTE2: The more you have, the harder the game will become! 
Less is the opposite, it makes it easier.
